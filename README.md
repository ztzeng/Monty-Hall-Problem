The Monty Hall Problem derives from an American television game show: *Let's Make a Deal* ,named after its 
original host, Monty Hall. 

The problem can be formally stated as following:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: 
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. 

You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. 

He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?


Proof.md will show the multiple solution and MontyHall.py will show the simulation process.
